**Dr. Michael W Young**, June 2019 - May 2021

I worked as a research assistant in the Young Lab at Rockefeller University. I sought to characterize interactions between key clock proteins in circadian rhythm. In my work with an undergraduate course at Hunter College, I also assisted in prepping materials for the course and connecting genetic alleles to sleep disorders, chronotypes, and cell-autonomous circadian clocks.
