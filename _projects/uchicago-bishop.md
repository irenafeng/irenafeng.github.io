**Dr. Douglas K Bishop**, September 2016 - May 2018

I worked as a research assistant in the Bishop Lab at the University of Chicago. My project focused on identifying small molecules that affect CRISPR/Cas9 gene knock-in efficiency. Some skills I've developed in my time here include different areas of tissue culture, flow cytometry, and various methods in gene targeting.
