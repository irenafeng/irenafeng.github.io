**Dr. Angie Serrano**, Apr 2023 - July 2023

I worked as a summer rotation student in the Serrano Lab at the Center for Regenerative Medicine at Boston University School of Medicine. My project focused on the development of a flow cytometry-based protocol for epigenetic modifications. Our goal was to design a high-throughput assay for cell cycle discrimination of histone marks with a high degree of sensitivity and quantification.
