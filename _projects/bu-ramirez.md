**Dr. Maria Ramirez**, June 2014 - August 2014

This research internship matched high school students with mentors in different labs, and I was placed in the Ramirez Lab at Boston University. My primary role in this lab was to confirm whether a certain gene was knocked out in a mutant mouse model. In order to achieve this, I determined the genotypes of the mice through PCR and gel electrophoresis. After determining the genotypes of the parent mice, I used fluorescent immunohistochemistry to analyze the lungs of mice embryos at different stages of development, and confirm gene knockout.
